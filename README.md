# Splunk-Phantom, API client.
Client library for Phantom's REST API.

Developed for use with Phantom v4.5+, however, most functionality *should work 
with previous versions.

Developed for use with Python3.8+, however, it should work with 3.6/7+. There is
no guarantee that future development won't utilize 3.8+ specifc syntax.

__*Not Affiliated with Splunk or Phantom__

## Installation
```bash
pip install phantom-api-client
```

## Basic Usage
This modules' primary use-case is inheritance from other REST API clients.

```python

```

## Special Features (Not Offered by REST API)
- [ ] Get containers; Filtered by Date-Range

## API Implementation, Categories (2/24) ~8.3%, Functions (32/118) ~27.1%
__*These should match unit tests.__

## Known Issues
Mass deleting records quits early with timeout error. It would seem the more 
records that are being deleted adds an exponential increase in wait between 
deletes. So far in testing >= 47 (254) 114 at once results in timeout-error.


Phantom v4.2 and earlier has completely broken pagination. You will receive 
duplicate and missing records. You should set the query filter 'page_size' to 
a number greater than the max expected results in order to receive all records 
in a single page.
